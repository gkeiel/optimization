# optimization

A repository of algorithms for mathematical and heuristic optimization of an objective function. Each algorithm has its own folder, containing the code for the function and a standalone example.

##

Main file named as 'optimization_main.m'. which allows to call any of the methods to solve an optimization problem:
- [gradient descent](./gradient_descent)
- [hill climbing](./hill_climbing)
- [simulated annealing](./simulated_annealing)

Consider an objective function...
